 ArrayList-
 
 It is the child interface of Collection
-> If we want to represent a group of individual objects where duplicates are allowed and 
insertion order is preserved. Then we should go for List.
> We can differentiate duplicate Objects and we can maintain insertion order by means of 
index hence "index plays important role in List"
